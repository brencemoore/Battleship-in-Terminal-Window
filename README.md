=== Battleship in Terminal ===

I created this project and game during the fall semester of my freshmen year.
The exact date was 9/15/2023.
I made this because I though it was a simple game that could be coded with my skill level.


=== Files ===

I only have this readme file, the c++ source code, and an executable for the game as I was just learning how to code.
If the executable does not work you may have to compile the game.cpp file.


=== How to Use ===

After running the executable, the user is asked how many ships they want to have to guess in a 10x10 board.
The location, rotation, and size of the ships is random between certain parameters in the code.
The user must guess as stated (letter then number).
The game is best played if opening a terminal first and then running the executable file.
The player gets an unlimited amount of guesses.
Once all of the locations where a ship is present are guessed the game ends.


=== Issues ===

If the number of ships entered by the user is too high then ships may clip through each other
If there are any spaces or a letter or digit is swapped, the program will likely crash or break.


=== Future ===

I will likely not revisit this program, but I know I could improve on some of the issues mentioned and add new features.
However, I think this project allowed me to exercise my new coding skills and I learned a lot while making it!
